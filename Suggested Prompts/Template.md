Instructions for Creating a New Playbook:

Please create a folder that approximates the title of your playbook. Optionally create corresponding 'image' and 'other' folders for supporting files. In the main folder create a file named '[tile of your playbook].md' and use the following template to describe your prompt. Replace the bracketed sections with your content.
