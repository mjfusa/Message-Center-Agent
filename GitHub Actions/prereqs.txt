To run the suggested GitHub Action for deploying the Message Center Agent to Microsoft 365, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. Azure Service Principal
Purpose: Required for provisioning the app registration in Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) and granting admin consent for API permissions.
Steps:
Create a Service Principal in Azure using the Azure CLI:
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "GitHubActionSP" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
Save the output JSON, which includes clientId, clientSecret, tenantId, and subscriptionId.
Add the JSON as a GitHub secret named AZURE_CREDENTIALS.
2. Microsoft 365 Tenant
Purpose: Required to deploy the agent to Microsoft Teams and access the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
Requirements:
A Microsoft 365 tenant with admin access.
A Copilot license for testing the agent.
Custom app uploading enabled in the Teams Admin Center. Follow these instructions.
3. Teams Toolkit
Purpose: Automates the provisioning and deployment of the app to Microsoft Teams.
Steps:
Install the Teams Toolkit extension in Visual Studio Code.
Ensure the @microsoft/teamsfx-cli is installed globally:
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
4. Microsoft Entra App Registration
Purpose: Required for OAuth2.0 authentication and API access.
Steps:
Register the app in the Microsoft Entra portal.
Configure the following:
Redirect URI: https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect
API Permissions:
Microsoft Graph API: User.Read
Microsoft 365 Admin Center: ServiceMessage.Read.All
Grant admin consent for the permissions.
Save the clientId, tenantId, and clientSecret.
5. GitHub Secrets
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
AZURE_CREDENTIALS: JSON output from the Azure Service Principal creation.
M365_TENANT_ID: Tenant ID of your Microsoft 365 tenant.
CLIENT_ID: Application (client) ID from the Entra app registration.
CLIENT_SECRET: Client secret from the Entra app registration.
6. OpenAPI Configuration
Purpose: Required to define the security scheme for OAuth2.0 in the openapi.json file.
Steps:
Update the openapi.json file with the following:
"components": {
    "securitySchemes": {
        "OAuth2": {
            "type": "oauth2",
            "flows": {
                "authorizationCode": {
                    "authorizationUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize",
                    "tokenUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token",
                    "scopes": {
                        "https://graph.microsoft.com/ServiceMessage.Read.All": "Access Microsoft Graph API"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Replace {tenant-id} with your Microsoft 365 tenant ID.
7. Required Roles
For App Registration:
Application Administrator (recommended least-privileged role).
Global Administrator (required to grant admin consent).
For Teams Deployment:
Teams Administrator (recommended least-privileged role).
Global Administrator (broader permissions).
For Agent Usage:
Message Center Reader (recommended least-privileged role).
Other roles: Global Administrator, Service Support Administrator, or Service Administrator.
8. Teams Developer Portal
Purpose: Used to manage the app registration and OAuth2.0 settings.
Steps:
After provisioning with the Teams Toolkit, verify the OAuth2.0 client registration in the Teams Developer Portal.
Update the scope field with https://graph.microsoft.com/ServiceMessage.Read.All.
9. Node.js
Purpose: Required to run the Teams Toolkit CLI.
Steps:
Install Node.js (version 18 or higher).
Verify installation:
node -v
npm -v
10. Validation
After deployment, validate the app using the Teams Toolkit CLI:
npx @microsoft/teamsfx-cli validate
By meeting these prerequisites, you can successfully run the GitHub Action to deploy the Message Center Agent to Microsoft 365.
